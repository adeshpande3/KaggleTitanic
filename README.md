Kaggle Titanic Survival ML Competition

I've been using SciKit Learn to call different ML algorithms that can be used to create a model that predicts survival on the Titanic, given different characteristics on each passenger. Right now, the accuracies (when tested on Kaggle) are shown below:

Decision Tree - 70.81%
SVM - 76.55%
KNN (k = 17) - 78.95%
