Kaggle Titanic Survival ML Competition

I've been using SciKit Learn to call different ML algorithms that can be used to create a model that predicts survival on the Titanic, given different characteristics on each passenger. Right now, the accuracies (when tested on Kaggle) are shown below:

KNN (k = 17) - **78.95%**

SVM - **76.55%**

Logistic Regression - **76.55%**

Decision Tree - **70.81%**
